## How to setup

1. you need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "Python Installation") installed

2. you install the requirements


``` 
pip install -r requriements.txt
```

3. you need a wordlist in the folder of the main.py file
here is my [recommandation](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Fuzzing)

4. you need to replace CHANNELID1> with the channel that you want to use for scrap-chan

Now just run the main.py file

```
python main.py
```

### OPTIONAL

You can replace the default token with the token you normaly use 

then you only need to press 0 if you want to use this one (makes debugging easier)
